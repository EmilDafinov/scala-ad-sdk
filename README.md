The [SBT-revolver](https://github.com/spray/sbt-revolver) plugin is enabled in the project, 
which allows you to have SBT re-compile and re-start your application when a change
in the sources is detected


## Release process

### On version numbers
This project uses the [sbt-dynver](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver) plugin in order to generate its version
number. See the plugin documentation for more details.
Our behavior for snapshot versions is slightly different than the plugin default however: in particular, commits that 
are not tagged with a version tag are considered snapshots. Moreover, snapshot versions have '-SNAPSHOT' appended to 
their sbt-dynver generated version number, so that they can be pushed to oss.jfrog.org.

### Publishing artifacts
Every time the build runs successfully, it uploads the created project binaries
* In case `isSnapshot` is true, the build is a snapshot (development) build. 
The build artifacts will be uploaded to `oss.jfrog.org`
* In case `isSnapshot` is true, then the build is a release version.
The build artifacts will be uploaded to Bintray, with the release version matching the project version

### Creating a release
We always create the next release version from the current commit on master.

* Make sure the commit you want to release is pushed to the upstream repo
* Start by creating a new version tag for the current commit locally
	`git tag -a v[my-release-number-here] -m "my tag message"`
* Push your newly created tag to the upstream repo
